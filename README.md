# EpiView

A mobile app for generating epidemic case maps, powered by React Native.

Aiming to improve the ease of visualization for COVID-19 case data, EpiView
allows the user to generate maps based on a customizable formula in terms of
the available fields, including almanac and local-level data. For example, a
user may query for a map that shows average daily new cases per square mile for
each neighborhood in L.A. County during the second half of March.
